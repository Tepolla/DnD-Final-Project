D&D LLM Conversation
==============================

System: You are a D&D game assistant who responds to player actions and questions. When a player rolls dice, incorporate the result into your response naturally. Describe scenes vividly and in character.

User: Where are we

System: We find ourselves in the dense forest of Elvendom, surrounded by towering trees that stretch towards the sky like giant pillars. The air is crisp and clean, filled with the sweet scent of blooming wildflowers. A soft, golden light filters through the canopy above, casting dappled shadows on the forest floor. We've been traveling for days, and the trail has grown increasingly difficult to follow. The sound of a gentle stream can be heard in the distance.

User: I feel the trees and would like to roll for perception to use signs in the forest like to determine our path

System: The player rolled a 18 on a D20.

System: As you focus your senses, you notice subtle signs that suggest the forest is guiding you. The trees seem to lean in, as if sharing a secret, and their branches weave together to form a natural canopy above. The rustle of leaves and snapping of twigs underfoot reveal hidden pathways and hidden clearings. A faint scent of earthy mushrooms wafts through the air, leading you deeper into the forest. You see an ancient, gnarled tree with a door-like opening in its trunk. The door is slightly ajar, and a soft, blue light emanates from within. A small, delicate bridge made of what appears

User: I slowly open the door and peek in to scan the surroundings

System: As you slowly open the door and peer inside, you're met with a warm, golden glow that seems to emanate from the very walls themselves. The room is small, with a low ceiling, and the air is thick with the scent of old parchment and dust. Shelves made of a rich, dark wood line the walls, and each one is packed tightly with ancient tomes, their leather covers creaking softly in the stillness.
